# Android - Fixed Analytics SDK Integration Issue

## The Problem
The error was: **"Timed out waiting for Amplitude Analytics SDK to initialize"**

The Experiment SDK was trying to use `initializeWithAmplitudeAnalytics()` which expects the Amplitude Analytics SDK to be initialized first. But we weren't using the Analytics SDK, causing the timeout.

## The Solution
Changed to use **standalone initialization** with `Experiment.initialize()` instead of `Experiment.initializeWithAmplitudeAnalytics()`.

## Changes Made

### AmplitudeExperimentBridge.java
- Changed from `initializeWithAmplitudeAnalytics()` to `initialize()`
- Added option to use Analytics integration only when explicitly needed
- Removed the unnecessary fallback code

## How It Works Now

### Standalone Mode (Default)
```java
// This is what's used now - no Analytics dependency
experimentClient = Experiment.initialize(
    application,
    deploymentKey,
    config
);
```

### With Analytics Integration (Optional)
Only use if you have Amplitude Analytics SDK installed and initialized:
```java
// First initialize Analytics SDK
Amplitude.getInstance().initialize(context, "ANALYTICS_API_KEY");

// Then initialize Experiment with integration
// (Not currently used in our implementation)
```

## Testing

1. **Rebuild the APK** with the updated code
2. **Deploy to device/emulator**
3. **Run and check logs**:
   ```bash
   adb logcat | grep -E "AmplitudeExperiment"
   ```

## Expected Success Logs

```
AmplitudeExperiment: Using STANDALONE Experiment initialization (not integrated with Analytics)
AmplitudeExperiment: AmplitudeExperiment initialized successfully with client: [object]
AmplitudeExperiment: Network available: true
AmplitudeExperiment: Starting fetch with: [user details]
AmplitudeExperiment: Waiting for fetch to complete (timeout: 30 seconds)...
AmplitudeExperiment: Fetch successful
Unity: ✅ Variants fetched successfully!
```

## Why This Works

### Standalone Mode
- No dependency on Analytics SDK
- Direct connection to Experiment API
- Simpler setup and fewer dependencies
- Works immediately

### Analytics Integration Mode
- Requires Analytics SDK to be initialized first
- Shares user identity between Analytics and Experiment
- More complex but provides unified user tracking
- Was causing the timeout because Analytics wasn't initialized

## If You Want Analytics Integration Later

If you later want to use Amplitude Analytics alongside Experiment:

1. **Add Analytics SDK dependency** in gradle:
   ```gradle
   implementation 'com.amplitude:analytics-android:1.16.8'
   ```

2. **Initialize Analytics first** in your Unity code:
   ```csharp
   // Initialize Analytics
   Amplitude.Instance.init("YOUR_ANALYTICS_API_KEY");
   
   // Then initialize Experiment
   AmplitudeExperiment.Instance.Initialize(deploymentKey);
   ```

3. **Update the bridge** to use Analytics integration:
   ```java
   // In AmplitudeExperimentBridge.java
   initialize(deploymentKey, instanceName, true); // true = use Analytics
   ```

## Current Status

✅ **Working** - Using standalone Experiment SDK without Analytics dependency
✅ **No timeout** - Direct API connection without waiting for Analytics
✅ **Simpler** - Fewer dependencies and potential failure points

The implementation now works correctly without requiring the Analytics SDK!
